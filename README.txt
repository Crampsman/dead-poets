Hi all, anyone interested in my project.
This is my projects in Java. "Dead Poets Society" is a web application, where you can
send your little stories of science fiction. 

In this project, I used:

Languages:  Java EE, SQL, HTML, CSS, XML.
Technology: JSP.
Frameworks: Spring (Spring MVC, Spring Security), Hibernate.
Libraries:  Maven, JSTL.
Tools:      Eclipse, MySql, Tomcat.

More sensitive about the application.
To add your own publication, you must register. The registration form is validated at annotated fields in the POJO. 
Registered users fill out a form authentication, and then receive a link to his office, it is implemented using Spring Security.
Registered user on your page can add publications, and sort them by status confirmation. 
The administrator can add their publication, view other users publish and confirm them or delete them. Also, the administrator 
can view a list of users, remove from the app or disable.
